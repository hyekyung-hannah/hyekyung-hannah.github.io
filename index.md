My name is Hyekyung Han.
I am currently an MS. student at <a href="https://www.korea.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Korea University, Seoul</a>. 
<br /><br />
Before thath, I also did my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at Korea University.


I studied artificial neural networks for natural language processing, with as main aim to understand what they may teach us about processing of structure.
While artificial neural networks are of course far from the real brain, I hope that understanding the principles by which they can encode and process structure can teach us something that will lead to a better understanding of how language is processed by the human brain. 
<br /><br />

Already quite a while ago, I started my journey in academia studying physics.
At some point, I had to admit that although I think physics is very interesting and I love abstract systems, my true passion is really the beautifully complex system that is natural language.
While doing a master in Logic at the University of Amsterdam I was very lucky to discover the field of computational linguistics.
I am still very glad that I got the chance to have a job that allows me to try to find answers to the questions that intrigue me most.
<br /><br />

In my free time, I spend a lot of time training for pole dancing competitions. 
In 2018, my duo-partner Suzy and I won the national championships!
Curious what it looks like?
